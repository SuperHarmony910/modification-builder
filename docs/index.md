# Welcome to my dedicated Minecraft coding repository!
This is where I store all my resource packs and modifications (for Forge). Hope you like 'em!

## Inspiration & motivation.
I was first inspired by @MrCrayfish, his additions to Minecraft added an extra depth to vanilla MC that I desired to achieve, and so this is the start of my modding career.
A huge shoutout to @TechnoVisionDev for the the conspicuous and richly detailed lesson to modding!

## Why is my inquisitiveness based on Minecraft?
It wasn't just the trend, it was the endless creativity that empowered me to code for this game. The eternal freedom (scrap the ~~world border~~) 
and sheer commitment to make this blocky game thrive influenced me to contribute to this **masterpiece**.
