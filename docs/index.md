# Welcome to my dedicated Minecraft coding repository!

This is where I store all my resource packs and modifications (for Forge). Hope you like 'em!

## Inspiration & motivation.

I was first inspired by <strong>[@MrCrayfish](https://github.com/MrCrayfish)</strong>, his additions to Minecraft added an extra depth to vanilla MC that I desired to achieve, and so this is the start of my modding career.
A huge shoutout to <strong>[@TechnoVisionDev](https://github.com/TechnoVisionDev)</strong> for the the conspicuous and richly detailed lesson to modding!

## Why is my inquisitiveness based on Minecraft?

It wasn't just the trend, it was the endless creativity that empowered me to code for this game. The eternal freedom (scrap the ~~world border~~)
and sheer commitment to make this blocky game thrive influenced me to contribute to this **masterpiece**.
